        <p>Syracuse University charged just over $60,000 for tuition this year.  But that's just one expense parents and students face at the University.
</p>

        <p>The average cost for housing and food is $18,440 for students living on campus, and $17,170 for students living in close by off campus housing, according to Syracuse University estimates.  
</p>

        <p>The university also accounts for another estimated $3,709 for technology, transportation and other miscellaneous expenses.

        <p>In an interview with Syracuse local and SU student, Alexander Arefyev, he says his main expense is food.
</p>

        <p>“I would say that my main expenditures right now are definitely groceries and Ubers, so food and transportation,” he said.  “Regardless of what I'm doing in school I always need to pick up food.”

        <p><iframe title="Consumer Price Index: Relative Importance (Jan. 2024)" aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-y15Wz" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/y15Wz/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="638" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

        <p>From this data set we can see that the largest expenditure category is shelter, with 32.2% of relative importance.
</p>

        <p>And while the more niche focus of college students' main expenditures may differ from the nationwide average, food and transportation expenses still make up a decent chunk of the total relative importance.  Food expenses approximately took up about 14%, while transportation took up about 6%.
</p>

        <p>After looking at the CPI data and what the university estimated for student expenditures, Arefyev agreed with the obvious importance of consumers and students buying food.  However, he highlighted a few key expenses that stand out and exceeded the university’s data points for the average student.
</p>

 <p>“I think the average student would spend that for sure, and honestly if not more,” he said. ”I’d say that's probably about the minimum.”
</p>

  <p>Arefyev said that expense that he felt was represented the most inaccurate by the data was transportation, especially for college students.
</p>

   <p>“Transportation is definitely one that I think where people underestimate spending,” Arefyev said.  “It really adds up.  You think a $10 or $12 Uber isn’t that much but then you do that three times throughout the week you end up looking at a pretty big sum”.
</p>

    <p>Transportation expenses were estimated at $768 for both on campus and off campus students by the university.  In reality, this expense is likely much more.
